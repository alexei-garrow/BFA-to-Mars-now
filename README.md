# Inspired by the best possible financial advice we have BFA to the moon or was it mars?

This project is a 'financial advice' app, that eventually ended up sorting through some of the best quotations of the seven kingdoms to help take your finances to the moon.

I was part of a team of three with Tasman and Sarah, we worked on the API call, and setting that all up. We went through various API's and had to eliminate some ie the Kayne one, as this was a presented project. It was a great learning experience, and I look forward to creating more of these projects.
